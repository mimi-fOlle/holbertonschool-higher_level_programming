# Python - Classes and Objects

-   [Object Oriented Programming](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/5envVBirO286MdSZgZ4DoQ "Object Oriented Programming")  (_Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes,  `classmethod`  and  `staticmethod`  yet_)
-   [Object-Oriented Programming](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/sCdUrEsHLFH2NpUzI5Xx8w "Object-Oriented Programming")  (_Please *_be careful*_: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes (You DON’T have to learn about class attributes), Methods, The  `__init__`  Method, “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “Public, Protected, and Private Attributes”_)

## More Info

**Documentation is now mandatory!**  Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments.  [Example Google Style Python Docstrings](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/WK6oRgAsdc3cSB4XHgE_1A "Example Google Style Python Docstrings")
